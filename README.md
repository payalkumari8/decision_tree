# Introduction to Decision Tree

A graphical representation of all the possible solutions to a decision based on certain conditions.

In order to build a tree, a decision tree algorithm is used called CART. CART stand for Classification And Regression Tree. 

It is a supervised learning technique since it is provided a labeled training dataset in order to construct the classification or regression tree model.

It is based on Gini's impurity index as splitting criterion.


The link below will give you a basic idea about the decision tree with CART algorithm.
